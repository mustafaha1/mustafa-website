        board.</h1>

    <p>
        I make sure I add all the steps that I am taking on my Trello board in order then I start putting all steps in to action
        at the moment I think of using the vs editor for the website which I am going to build and use a background image for
        the website and how many pages I wanted to be and how to link them with web pages inside my website and also I link them

        <h1>2.3 Strengths and weaknesses of final project</h1>
        <p>
            I think my strengths are that it looks solid and there are no weird elements that seem out of place, I think if I were to re-do it again I would pick a better and more lively theme because I was gonig for a minimalistic/simplistic scheme, I just think It would look cooler.</p>

            <h1>â€¢ 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“ what </h1>

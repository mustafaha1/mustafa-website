You begin a 6-month long website build project. Two months in, Apple releases a new version of iOS, and the site you
have in development doesnâ€™t work properly on the new iOS version.
Halfway through a project, your company merges with another company, which has a very different go-to-market strategy.
Three months into a website build project, a competitor releases a new site with a great new feature that could draw
your customers away.
A key team member departs your company for another opportunity mid-way through the project.

    To choose the right technology you first have to understand the need for the job, you need to know specifically what it is that you want done, so you get better options by the process of elimination for e.g. if you want to make a phone application, use one of JavaScripts frameworks like Ionic.

How has
Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your code version control?
Using Trello had been a great pleasure I had at my last project therefor it helped me through every steps I was taking
or preplanning my last it helped me by keeping everything in order and the secstion had been done it was already on the
card or the section which has espoused to be done it was still on progress card and the an even I had a card showing
what I am doing right now in general it worked really well for me

    <h1>7: â€¢ 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects â€“ How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h1>
    <p>In May 2018 a new European privacy regulation called GDPR was enforced and permanently changed the way, as a business,
    collect, store and use customer data.
    Therefor from 25 May 2018, the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) will affect every organisation that
    processes the personal information of EU residents, Tens of thousands of organisations around the world are facing a
    major upheaval in the way they process data. Complying with GDPR is not straight forward. It will require detailed
    planning and collaboration with all the businesses in in the chain.
    Guidance from institutions including the UKâ€™s ICO identifies three areas GDPR will impact digital marketing: consent,
    data access and data processing.
    the company must be more vigilant in order to collect data from the customer and how they are using it in the future.

    <p>I was struggling with drop down and I went back to test a few way such as flex box it didnâ€™t work and I came back to test a different programme or syntax and again it didnâ€™t work again I had many test all the way until I found the solution. </p> -->

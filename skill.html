    <h1>2.1 The ongoing use of IT tools and change approach</h1>
<p>
    I have used  Visual Studio Code as my coding tool however it was quite new to me but it does the job well, I also really like the colours of it. Trello has been helpful too as it helps me to remember which parts I still need to do overall
    using both Trello and Visual Studio have been useful throughout the creation of my website. Trello has has helped to keep the project on track by highlighting
    the tasks I have completed. 
</p>

            <h1>2.2 Were the IT tools selected appropriate?</h1>
<p>
    
    Yes I believe the tools I used were appropriate but I haven't really used Trello as much as I need it towards the end of projects because I could remember all the tasks I had left, Visual Studio Code has been extremely useful to me and it's features saving me a lot of time. In my opinion, both Trello and VS were appropriate for the project as Trello keeps the project on track and VS enables the project to be created.
    VS was useful as a single piece of software that enabled all the coding to be performed without the use of any other tools.

<h1>2.3 Strengths and weaknesses of final project</h1>
<p>
     My strengths at final project are that it looks solid and there are no weird elements that seem out of place, I think if I re-do itit again I would pick a better and more lively theme because I was gonig for a minimalistic/simplistic scheme, I just think It would look cooler. in general, I'm happy with how my website has turned out. Althogh it is relatively simplistic, it is easy to navigate and the layout facilitiates navigation.
I would have like to include some extras for example, (a sign up page or log in log out)  a light box with imagery or some other boxing text to make the site experience more dynamic.

</p>

    <h1>2.4 Further improvements I can make to my project</h1>
<p> 
    I could probably add a theme switch on button click and maybe add more images to make it look more fancy and incorporate flex to make the website more mobile friendly or maybe I could add more dynamic elements to the site as previously mentioned such as a lightbox or moving text in the form of a banner for example.
    If I had more time I would research more colour schemes and themes to make the site more visually appealing.

    <h1>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements</h1>
    <p>
        I have tried my best to make sure the criteria is met and that I have no error pages, and such things, I also made sure everything has a label and a purpose and there are no dead ends or anything like thati also wanted to ensure that the site has no major errors, that the appropriate links are working and that the site functions as intended.
        I had to make lots of changes overall, layout as it included too many pages that were unneccesary and I changed the colour scheme and banner as they were not visually pleasing.

        <!-- <h1>â€¢ 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency </h1>

        <p>i think we could have been more productive, efficient if we did this project in a team we could have been ahead and probably we could have done the java script during this week but unfortunatly we have fallen behind as some of our team mate didnt know much aboout coding</p> -->

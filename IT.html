    <h1> 1: â€¢ 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business?</h1>


       

<p>Information technology drives innovation and innovation is the path to business success. Innovation in business has the
same impact that steam had on the industrial revolution, 
in fact, itâ€™s hard to imagine any business that has not benefited from the digital revolution. Even something as hands
on as agriculture uses computers. Farmers use computers for production records, financial planning, research on
technical issues, and procurement.</p><br><br>

<p>Nowadays the formula for business success is simple: drive innovation with information technology. So, the first thing
startups in any industry try to figure out is how to make smart IT recruiting choices. Without a backbone of information
technology, a business is not going to go far, technology has important effects on business operations. No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both
tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand.
Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the
security of confidential information and trade advantages.</p><br><br>

<p>Technology also helps a business understand its cash flow needs and preserve precious resources such as time and
physical space. Warehouse inventory technologies let business owners understand how best to manage the storage costs of
holding a product. With proper technology in place, executives can save time and money by holding meetings over the
Internet instead of at corporate headquarters.

    <h1> 1: â€¢ 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business?</h1>


       

<p>Information technology drives innovation and innovation is the path to business success. Innovation in business has the
same impact that steam had on the industrial revolution, 
in fact, itâ€™s hard to imagine any business that has not benefited from the digital revolution. Even something as hands
on as agriculture uses computers. Farmers use computers for production records, financial planning, research on
technical issues, and procurement.</p><br><br>

<p>Nowadays the formula for business success is simple: drive innovation with information technology. So, the first thing
startups in any industry try to figure out is how to make smart IT recruiting choices. Without a backbone of information
technology, a business is not going to go far, technology has important effects on business operations. No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both
tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand.
Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the
security of confidential information and trade advantages.</p><br><br>

<p>Technology also helps a business understand its cash flow needs and preserve precious resources such as time and
physical space. Warehouse inventory technologies let business owners understand how best to manage the storage costs of
holding a product. With proper technology in place, executives can save time and money by holding meetings over the
Internet instead of at corporate headquarters.</p><br><br>

<h1>2: 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h1>

	<p>
        what do you need to
        make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
        Roles and responsibilities, define key roles and responsibilities for your team & external suppliers, ensure everyone
        knows what they are expected to contribute and when, common project roles: Decision makers Project manager, Copywriter
        or editor, Developer and Designer
        
        You need management, collaboration, communication hardware software and cloud file storage systems, all this work is
        getting done efficiently and with better results. These digital projects are the new faces of project management, as the
        Technology is moving so fast, we must keep up with the skill which is required.
        </p>

        <h1>3:1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello
            board.</h1>
    
        <p>
            I make sure I add all the steps that I am taking on my Trello board in order then I start putting all steps in to action
            at the moment I think of using the vs editor for the website which I am going to build and use a background image for
            the website and how many pages I wanted to be and how to link them with web pages inside my website and also I link them
            with my Trello board at <a href="https://trello.com/b/WEiiSKAT/web-site" target="_blank">(https://trello.com/b/WEiiSKAT/web-site)</a>
            .</p>


<!-- <h1>2.1 The ongoing use of IT tools and change approach</h1>
<p>
    I have used  Visual Studio Code as my coding tool however it was quite new to me but it does the job well, I also really like the colours of it. Trello has been helpful too because it helps me remember which parts I still need to do .
</p>

<h1> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems?</h1>

    <p>Using the systems and the tools i was using was quite efficience from there that I enjoy learnng more i dont think there is not many drawbacks for me however i think it could have more efficient if we could dothis in a team as long as i know developer are the coders not the designer if did this in group we might have more ideas as looks of the website</p> -->

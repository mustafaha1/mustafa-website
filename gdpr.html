    <h1> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems?</h1>

    <p>Using the systems and the tools I was using was quite efficience from there that I enjoy learnng more i dont think there is not many drawbacks for me however i think it could have more efficient if we could do this in a team as long as i know developer are the coders not the designer if did this in group we might have more ideas as looks of the website</p>

    <h1>â€¢ 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency </h1>

        <p>I think we could have been more productive, efficient if we did this project in a team we could have been ahead and probably we could have done the java script during this week but unfortunatly we have fallen behind as some of our team mate didnt know much aboout coding or may be if i had a few more breaks, having a cup of coffe relaxed more and taking easy on the projects could have improved ingeneral i could do a lot more to keep myself on track instead of stressing</p>

        <h1>â€¢ 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“ what </h1>
        <p>If I do any project next time I would do in a team and make sure everybody is using same platform such as Trello or github and I make sure their are on slack all the time just incase if they have any idea the can share it with us right away and we would do stands up and i make sure that every body understand exatly what we are expecting from this project as this time just a missunderstanding caused me so much trouble </p>

        <h1> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions  </h1>
        <p>I make sure every time i write a few lins of codes I tested befor I carry on as it could be a lot easyer  to find a solution at the early stage of the project rather than later if there is any issues I was struggling with drop down and I went back to test a few way such as flex box it didnâ€™t work and I came back to test a different programme or syntax and again it didnâ€™t work again I had many test all the way until I found the solution. </p>
